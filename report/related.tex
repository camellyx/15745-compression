Gennady Pekhimenko et. al proposed Base-Delta-Immediate Compression~\cite{bdi}. The key
idea in Base-Delta-Immediate Compression is that data in any cache frequently
have low dynamic range and hence can be compressed with a common base and small
variations or deltas from this base. The authors observe that for many cache
lines, multiple bases are required for efficient compressing due to multi-field
data structures. Trishul Chilimbi et al. proposed Cache-Conscious Structure
Layout~\cite{cache-layout}. The key idea in Cache-Conscious Structure Layout is that by coloring
and clustering pointers, pointers with spatial locality are grouped together
into a single cache line which improves data reuse. Trishul Chilimbi et al. take
the concept further in Cache-Conscious Structure Definition~\cite{cache-def}. In
Cache-Conscious Structure Definition, fields within a structure are further
split into different fields which are reordered to further increase cache
locality and data reuse. Recently, Chris Lattner et al. proposed Automatic Pool
Allocation~\cite{lattner1}, which segregates heap-based data into separate memory pools and
controls the internal data layout with heuristics. The key idea is to analyze
heap allocated data with a points-to graph and a call graph. Grouping data with
spatial locality together, improves performance. Finally, Stephen Curial
proposed MPADS: Memory-Pooling-Assisted Data Splitting~\cite{mpads}, which analyzes
affinity (locality) between fields in a structure and splits data fields based
on their affinity to reduce memory footprint and improve applicationâ€™s
performance. Fields with low affinity are separated into different pools while
fields with high affinity are bundled together at the granularity of each
element. Memory-Pooling-Assisted Data Splitting improves data reuse by pooling
fields with high affinity while improving memory efficiency by splitting
isolated fields.
