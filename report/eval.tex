\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
We evaluate the benefits of our implementation on our micro-benchmark (described above) across a range of parameters. We implement the compression algorithm in the last level of cache. The metrics used for evaluation are the miss rate in the last level of cache in MPKI and the effective cache capacity increase or effective compression ratio (ECR) which measures the compressibility of the data that can actually be utilized with the limitations of hardware implementation. Figure .. shows the benefits of the splitting optimization for different data set sizes. Figure .. illustrates the interaction between locality and splitting. Here there are two different access patterns - streaming and random accesses. With a streaming access pattern the.... The splitting benefits for different field affinities is depicted in figure .. Here we vary the probability that two fields are accessed together. .... And finally, we evaluate the impact of our optimization for different field types.
