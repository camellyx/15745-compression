\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:fut}

As part of our future work, we intend to integrate Memory Pooling with Data
Splitting to enable data splitting in cases where nodes are dynamically
allocated at runtime. We also intend to develop a profiling model based on our
experiments to evaluate the potential benefits from splitting, to detect the
best grouping of fields within a structure and help strike an optimized balance
between locality and compressibility
